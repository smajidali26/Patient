# PHI Redaction Application

The PHI Redaction Application is a tool designed to redact sensitive personal health information (PHI) from uploaded files. This project includes a backend built in .NET Core and a frontend built with Angular, allowing users to upload files and have their sensitive information automatically redacted before downloading.

### Project Structure

This project is organized into the following components:

- **Backend (.NET Core)**: The backend handles file uploads, processes the content line by line, redacts sensitive information, and returns the processed file.
- **Frontend (Angular)**: The frontend provides a user interface for file selection, uploading, and redaction. 

### Features

- Upload text files containing sensitive information.
- Automatic redaction of names, SSNs, phone numbers, and email addresses.
- Downloads the redacted version of the file.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or higher)
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (for Angular frontend)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (optional, for running Angular commands)

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend project folder.
   ```bash
   cd PHIRedactionApp
   ```

2. Restore dependencies.
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Run the backend server.
   ```bash
   dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:5000"
   ```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend project folder.
   ```bash
   cd PHIRedactionApp/ClientApp
   ```

2. Install dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend server.
   ```bash
   ng serve --open
   ```

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:4200`.

### Usage

1. Start both the backend and frontend servers.
2. Open the application in your browser (by default at `http://localhost:4200`).
3. Select a text file with PHI data that needs redaction (e.g., containing names, SSNs, phone numbers, and emails).
4. Click **Upload & Redact** to process the file.
5. Download the redacted file.

### API Endpoints

The backend API provides the following endpoints:

- **POST /api/files/upload**: Accepts a file for redaction. Processes the file line by line, redacts sensitive data, and returns the sanitized file.

#### Sample Request

```http
POST /api/files/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
File: [Upload your file here]
```

### Regex Patterns

The following regular expressions are used to identify and redact specific types of sensitive information:

- **Names**: Detects patient name in text.
- **SSN (Social Security Number)**: Matches standard 9-digit SSN formats (e.g., `123-45-6789`).
- **Phone Number**: Matches various phone number formats, including international and local patterns.
- **Email**: Matches standard email formats (e.g., `example@domain.com`).
- **Date of Birth**: Matches DOB of a patient.
- **Address**: Matches address information for a patient.
- **Medical Record**: Matches Medical Record formats (e.g., `MRN-0012345`).

These patterns can be customized in `RedactionProcessor.cs` for more specific use cases.

### Code Highlights

- **File Processing**: The backend processes files asynchronously line-by-line to handle large files efficiently.
- **Design Patterns**: The application utilizes dependency injection and follows the repository pattern for clear separation of concerns.
- **CORS Configuration**: Ensure that CORS is configured properly to avoid cross-origin issues between Angular and .NET Core. Adjust `AllowAnyOrigin` settings in the backend.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Additional PHI Types**: Expand regex patterns to cover additional PHI types such as addresses, medical IDs, and insurance numbers.
2. **Improved UI**: Make the frontend more responsive and visually appealing with better error handling and feedback.
3. **File Type Support**: Extend support to handle different file types, such as PDFs and Word documents, using OCR for text extraction.
4. **Logging and Error Handling**: Implement better error handling and logging mechanisms for production-level debugging.
